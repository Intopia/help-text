# Accessible help text

Demo version: https://intopia.github.io/help-text/

Help text is information associated with an individual form control that provides information for the user on how to fill in the field correctly. If the help text is not correctly associated with the relevant form controls, assistive technology users may not hear these text labels announced as they navigate through forms.

Help text should be programmatically associated with its relevant form controls.

This repo tests 3 different cases.
